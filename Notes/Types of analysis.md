##Types of analysis
-### Descriptive
	No decisions - just description
	Interpretation of data is different thing than describing
	Cannot be generalised
	eg. Census, Google Ngram Viewer

-### Exploratory 
	Find relations, discovering connections
	Should not be used for generalization or predicting
	*Corelation does not imply causation
	eg. identifing the regions of brains that respond to a particular stimulus
	eg. sloan digital sky - pictures of night sky to discover new stars or learn how the universe works

-### Inference
	Taking small data and extrapolate/generalize for larger population
	Estimating quantity and its uncertainty
	Inference depends heavily on population and sampling scheme
	eg. Effect of Air Pollution on Life Expectancy

-### Predictive Analysis (more challenging)
	Use data on some objects to predict values for another object
	Heavily depends on right variables
	More data and simple models tend to work really well
	eg. Nate Silver's Presedential Election predictions on FiveThirtyEight

-### Casual Analysis
	Effect of one variable on other
	Randomised studies to identify causation
	Identified as average effect but may not apply to individuals
	Gold standard for data analysis
	eg. Randomised treatments to patient to find out the most effective one

-### Mechanistic Analysis
	Understand exact changes in variables that lead to changes in individual objects
	Mostly applicable in physical/engineering science
	If equations are known but the parameters are not, then they can be infered by data analysis
	eg. Effect of pavment design on its functionality


## What is Data ?

Values of qualitative or quantitaive variables belonging to a set of items 

Population - set of objects you are interested in

Variables - measure of characteristic of an item (qualitative/quantitative)

Eg. Human genomic data, Medical records, APIs, Multimedia content 

### Data is second most important, the first is the question.
